# Text Classification

The goal of this repository is to implement text classification in traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods (in Pytorch).

## Models

- [x] BOW (Bag of Words) + Decision Tree: 0.7065
- [x] TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) + Decision Tree: 0.7049
